## Welcome! Who/what/where is SOPHIA SoCal and why does it exist?

SOPHIA SoCal is a monthly informal gathering in Orange County, CA, consisting of Orthodox Christian laymen and clergy who are  philosophers, thinkers, teachers, or simply interested in philosophy and Orthodox theology.

We meet monthly to offer fellowship, connect Orthodox philosophers and like-minded people, and provide a forum for an Orthodox engagement with enduring ideas of contemporary relevance.  

Come dialog with us! 

If you'd like to join, contact Herman Slavens at the following:  osleibh youknowwhat gmail dot com.

### Current Meeting

As far as content goes, I have proposed that we start with David Bradshaw's Aristotle East and West: Metaphysics and the Division of Christendom. 

This book would be supplemented by primary texts (e.g., by Aristotle, Aquinas, or St. Gregory Palamas) discussed in each chapter. Other, future texts for discussion could range from Alistair McIntyre's After Virtue, Khaled Anatoliosâ€™s Retrieving Nicaea: The Development and Meaning of Trinitarian Doctrine, or The Foundations of Christian Bioethics by Engelhardt, Jr.
