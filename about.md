I've now received a blessing from Fr. Michael to form a reading group on philosophy and Orthodoxy and I wanted to share both what my vision is and some specifics, as well as get thoughts from others.
 
While not necessary, I envision this group as a SOPHIA chapter. 

“SOPHIA” is the Society of Orthodoxy Philosophers in American, co-founded by Dr. H. Tristram Engelhardt, Jr. (aka Rdr Herman). SOPHIA has an annual conference (usually in February) at Holy Archangels Monastery in Kendalia, TX. 

We are continuing and extending the work of this conference by offering fellowship, connecting Orthodox philosophers and like-minded people, and providing a forum for an Orthodox engagement with enduring ideas of contemporary relevance.  
 
This group is open to any Orthodox Christian  whether they are philosophers or not or have any formal background in philosophy. Also, though everyone on this email list is a man, I do not envision this as a men’s group.

- The general idea is pretty simple: a reading group on philosophical topics and the history of ideas as they relate to and intersect with Orthodox theology and the Church.
 
- I think the group should be small -- 15 people at most. 

- I would like this to be a group for those with a serious interest in philosophy and the history of ideas and who are willing to study and discuss scholarly texts, including primary texts. 
 

4.  This is not a class and there would be no teacher or lectures. I do not see myself, or anyone else thus far, as teaching a course. This would be a reading group only. Though, if anyone wanted to share relevant current research or work, I think that would be welcome.
 

5.  My initial thought is that the group would function somewhat like a graduate seminar. We would read a chapter and one person would present a summary with some questions for discussion. I thought meeting just once a month would make a good start. 
 

6.  As far as content goes, I have proposed that we start with David Bradshaw's Aristotle East and West: Metaphysics and the Division of Christendom. This book would be supplemented by primary texts (e.g., by Aristotle, Aquinas, or St. Gregory Palamas) discussed in each chapter. Other, future texts for discussion could range from Alistair McIntyre's After Virtue, Khaled Anatolios’s Retrieving Nicaea: The Development and Meaning of Trinitarian Doctrine, or The Foundations of Christian Bioethics by Engelhardt, Jr. I’m sure others will have many other suggestions.
 

The questions we need to answer, as I see it, are: First, is everyone in agreement about the book? Second, is meeting only once a month a good or bad idea? Third, where can we meet? On this last question, I would prefer a seminar-like setting, but maybe that’s asking too much. I haven’t asked Fr. Michael about using a room at St. Barnabas.
 
Please raise any suggestions or give feedback. Once we get everything settled, we should pick a time. At least initially, meeting a couple hours before Vespers might work.
 
I will be gone this upcoming weekend visiting my father for Father’s Day. I look forward to talking with you all soon.
