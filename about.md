In the summer of 2007, a few friends started a book club. We fell in love with discussion at Wheatstone Academy, Biola University, and reading a lot in our own homes. That book club lasted for 6 years before it finally dissolved. We met every week almost without fail. Many people came and went. Many books were read. When the hosts finally moved to South Carolina, we grieved and moved on.

We have since been involved in other discussion groups. The Buhlers started a book group in Kentucky that lasted for two years. Back in CA we have continued to read but clubs have been inconsistent. But it's time to get involved in something regular again. 

Hence the Chesterton Club (as of yet unofficial) has been resurrected!

Join us!
