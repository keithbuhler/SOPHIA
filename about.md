In June 2017, Fr. Michael Reagan (of St. Barnabas Orthodox Church) blessed a reading group on philosophy and Orthodoxy.

The general idea is pretty simple: a reading group on philosophical topics and the history of ideas as they relate to and intersect with Orthodox theology and the Church. The group should be small: 15 people at most, at least for now.

That said, this meeting was conceived as an unofficial chapter of the Society of Orthodoxy Philosophers in America (SOPHIA) which was co-founded by Dr. H. Tristram Engelhardt, Jr. SOPHIA proper has an annual conference at Holy Archangels Monastery in Texas. 

We, the diaspora in Southern California, aim to continue the work of this conference by offering fellowship, connecting Orthodox philosophers and like-minded people, and providing a forum for an Orthodox engagement with enduring ideas of contemporary relevance.  
 
SOPHIA SoCal is open to any Orthodox Christian men and women whether they are philosophers or not or have any formal background in philosophy.  However, it is important that members have a serious interest in the history of ideas and be willing to study and discuss scholarly texts, including primary texts. 

SOPHIA is not a class and there would be no teacher or lectures. This would be a reading group only. (Though, if anyone wanted to share relevant current research or work, that would be welcome.)

Rather, the group functions like a graduate seminar where we read a chapter or piece and one person presents a summary with questions for discussion.
