In June 2017, Fr. Michael Reagan (of St. Barnabas Orthodox Church) blessed a reading group on philosophy and Orthodoxy.

This group as a chapter of “SOPHIA”, the Society of Orthodoxy Philosophers in American, co-founded by Dr. H. Tristram Engelhardt, Jr. (aka Rdr Herman). SOPHIA proper has an annual conference (usually in February) at Holy Archangels Monastery in Kendalia, TX. 

We are continuing and extending the work of this conference by offering fellowship, connecting Orthodox philosophers and like-minded people, and providing a forum for an Orthodox engagement with enduring ideas of contemporary relevance.  
 
This group is open to any Orthodox Christian men and women whether they are philosophers or not or have any formal background in philosophy.  However, it is important that members have a serious interest in philosophy and the history of ideas and who are willing to study and discuss scholarly texts, including primary texts. 

The general idea is pretty simple: a reading group on philosophical topics and the history of ideas as they relate to and intersect with Orthodox theology and the Church. The group should be small: 15 people at most, at least for now.

SOPHIA is not a class and there would be no teacher or lectures. This would be a reading group only. (Though, if anyone wanted to share relevant current research or work, that would be welcome.)

Rather, the group would function like a graduate seminar where we read a chapter or piece and one person presents a summary with questions for discussion.
